# Bounties for ETHSanFrancisco
Hey Hackers, unsure of what to work on for ETHSanFrancsico? Consider taking a look at what you can build with Kyber! One thing that we'd like to promote is the spirit of collaboration, and leveraging our protocol for use in other projects. For example, [InstaDapp](https://ethindia.conteract.io/) was put together in ETHIndia, where they won $3k in DAI.

### 1. Collateral liqudation on-chain
Lending platforms such as ETHLend, Dharma and Bloqboard allow for ERC20 tokens to be put as collateral. In the event of loan defaults, you could allow for the lender to liqudate the collateral to whatever token he wishes.

### 2. Off-chain virtual orderbook relayer
Exchanges like 0x have their orderbooks off-chain, with relayers to create, match and fill orders. You could build a relayer to feed Kyber reserves' rates and amounts to these relayers. Whenever settlement occurs, perform the trade with Kyber to obtain the tokens required and settle on 0x's market.

### 3. Integration into MakerDAO's CDP
The creation and closing of a CDP can only be done with ETH and DAI respectively. Futhermore, the process is rather tedious and complicated, where one has to understand the mechanism well. Consider simplifying the process to make it user-friendly and easy to create a CDP to obtain DAI, and closing one with ERC20 tokens.

### 4. Arbitrage Bots
Need Spyros' input to proceed.
